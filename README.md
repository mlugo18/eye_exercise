# Eye Exercise

## Description: 
This repository contains the JavaScript code and HTML files used to create two eyes on the web browser. The eyes are coded to follow the movement of the mouse as it moves over the area of the browser. Once the mouse leaves the browser area, the eyes will remain looking at the direction in which the mouse left the browser area.

## How to Run:
Clone the full repository to reside in a single registry. Load the index.html file to a web browser and move the mouse over the area in the browser to see the eyes follow the mouse's movement. 

## Roadmap of Future Improvements: 
You can add more eyes to the script and change the colors, as desired. An additional enhancement is to have the eyes reset to look forward when the mouse leaves the browser area. At this time, the eyes will remain looking at the direction in which the mouse left the browser area.
